This project I/We will be using QEMU to convert the kali_purple.vdhd 
# this is an image you would create using vmware as the building platform for the kali purple iso 
to create an instance of kali with your own user name ect 
now as you may know kali has just released a new iso kali purple this new iso has five amazing tool sets for you to learn dev explore
